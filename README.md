I founded **Love & Kindness GmbH**, a digital agency, product studio and umbrella company for whatever I want to work on. Right now, I'm pouring most of my energy into [PIQY](https://www.piqy.de), while still working on client projects, collaborating with lovely friends.

I'm also a [Certified Kirby CMS Partner](https://getkirby.com/partners/tobias-moeritz) and have published a [few open-source plugins (some paid, like DreamForm)](https://plugins.andkindness.com/) to hopefully make other developers' work a bit smoother.

I started freelancing at the age of 14, later dropped out of high school, and since then worked on a lot of projects with tons of companies that hopefully didn't change their mission since then.
